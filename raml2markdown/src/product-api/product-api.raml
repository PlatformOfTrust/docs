  The Product API provides means to manage products provided by PoT core.
  The product defines the URL to the translator, as well as a product code to
  use when requesting data from the translator.
  Note that when creating a new data product, the developer who creates it
  MUST belong to a group (organization), and POST that group ID in the
  request when creating the data product.
